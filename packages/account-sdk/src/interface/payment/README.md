# Payment Interface

The payment interface provides a simple way to make USDC payments on Base network using an ephemeral wallet.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { pay } from '@base-org/account-sdk';

// Basic payment
const payment = await pay({
  amount: "10.50",
  to: "0xFe21034794A5a574B94fE4fDfD16e005F1C96e51",
  testnet: true
});

if (payment.success) {
  console.log(`Payment sent! Transaction ID: ${payment.id}`);
} else {
  console.error(`Payment failed: ${payment.error}`);
}
```

## Checking Payment Status

You can check the status of a payment using the transaction ID returned from the pay function:

```typescript
import { getPaymentStatus } from '@base/account-sdk';

// Check payment status
const status = await getPaymentStatus({
  id: payment.id,
  testnet: true
});

switch (status.status) {
  case 'pending':
    console.log('Payment is still being processed...');
    break;
  case 'completed':
    console.log(`Payment completed! Amount: ${status.amount} to ${status.recipient}`);
    break;
  case 'failed':
    console.log(`Payment failed: ${status.error}`);
    break;
  case 'not_found':
    console.log('Payment not found');
    break;
}
```

## Information Requests (Data Callbacks)

You can request additional information from the user during payment using the `infoRequests` parameter:

```typescript
import { pay, InfoRequest } from '@base-org/account-sdk';

const payment = await pay({
  amount: "10.50",
  to: "0xFe21034794A5a574B94fE4fDfD16e005F1C96e51",
  testnet: true,
  infoRequests: [
    { request: 'email' },
    { request: 'physicalAddress', optional: true },
    { request: 'phoneNumber', optional: false },
    { request: 'name', optional: true },
    { request: 'onchainAddress' },
  ]
});
```

### Supported Information Types

- `email` - User's email address
- `physicalAddress` - User's physical address
- `phoneNumber` - User's phone number
- `name` - User's full name
- `onchainAddress` - User's on-chain address

### Optional vs Required

By default, all information requests are required (`optional: false`). You can make a request optional by setting `optional: true`.

#### InfoRequest

- `request: string` - The type of information being requested
- `optional?: boolean` - Whether the information is optional (default: false)
